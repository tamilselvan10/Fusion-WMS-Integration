  /* What is the PL/JSON definition of JSON Path? */
  -- In languages such as javascript and python, one can interact with a json
  -- structure in a sensible manner. In PL/JSON every object is converted into
  -- an anydata structure. When the object is converted back, you actually work
  -- on a copy. That makes nested structures quite difficult to work with. The
  -- aim of JSON Path is to support changes in nested structures.

  -- Suppose we want to change e : 7913 to e : 123. Then we might try to do it
  -- like this:
  tempobj := pljson(obj.get('c'));
  temparray := pljson_list(tempobj.get('d'));
  tempobj := pljson(temparray.last);
  dbms_output.put_line('Got the right inner json?');
  tempobj.print;
  dbms_output.put_line('Yes - now change the value');
  tempobj.put('e',123);
  tempobj.print;
  dbms_output.put_line('Excellent - but wait! Isn''t that reflected in the global object?');
  obj.print;
  dbms_output.put_line('Sadly no - we are working on copies that should be inserted again!');

  -- To make it work we should keep the copies and propergate them back into their positions.
  -- We're not gonna do that. Instead let JSON Path deal with it:
  dbms_output.put_line('Can JSON Path in JSON_EXT help us?');
  pljson_ext.put(obj, 'c.d[3].e', 123);
  obj.print;
  dbms_output.put_line('Great!');

  -- Some notes regarding the put methods:
  -- if you provide an invalid path then an error is raised (hopefully)
  -- you can, however, specify a path that doesn't exists but should be created.
  -- arrays are 1-indexed.
  -- spaces are significant outside array notation
  -- when a too large array is specified, the gaps will be filled with pljson_null's

  dbms_output.put_line('Example 1:');
  obj := pljson();
  pljson_ext.put(obj, 'a[2].data.value[1][2].myarray', pljson_list('[1,2,3]'));
  obj.print;

  -- use put to fill out the "holes"
  dbms_output.put_line('Example 2:');
  pljson_ext.put(obj, 'a[1]', 'filler1');
  pljson_ext.put(obj, 'a[2].data.value[1][1]', 'filler2');
  obj.print;

  -- replace larger structures:
  dbms_output.put_line('Example 3:');
  pljson_ext.put(obj, 'a[2].data', 7913);
  obj.print;

  -- the empty string is an error - and it doesn't make sense
